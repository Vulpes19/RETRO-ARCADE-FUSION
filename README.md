## Overview

RETRO-ARCADE FUSION is a game project I developed as part of my learning journey with Unity game engine. It features two classic arcade game modes: Breakout and Pong. This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in game development, from designing gameplay mechanics to implementing game physics and user interfaces.

## Features
- Two classical game modes:
